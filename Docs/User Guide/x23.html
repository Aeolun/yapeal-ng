>Not really sure since I haven't looked at them that close I can
      only tell you that Yapeal isn't setup as a class that you extend but is
      more procedural in nature while using some classes to do what it does.
      Also from what I've seen and read most the others seem to be made to be
      used by a single person or corporation in a single application where
      Yapeal is made to be used more as a command line script or as a Unix
      like crontab job to pull generic EVE information as will as stuff for
      multiple EVE corporations and individuals.</P
><P
>It can be used by a single corporation or charactor if you want
      but it was developed to be used in a multiple application framework
      where it needs to work for multiple users and applications without any
      extra programming work.</P
